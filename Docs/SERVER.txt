Misc notes on Server.py:

*On first run, it may hang for a while as it downloads 10mb of json. 
Don't panic and don't kill it.

If you did kill it, it'll start erroring on future runs due to the incomplete
json file. This files is Cards/AllSets.json . Delete it and let it redownload.


*To run a server that other computers on your local network can access:
  Run Server.py, changing "localhost" to your internal IP address.

To find your internal IP address (WINDOWS):
  Open a commnand prompt: Windows7: Start->type in the search box: cmd
                          Other Windows: Start->run->type: cmd

  At the command prompt, type:  ipconfig
  
  Note "IPv4 Address" under "Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:"
  (Probably starts with 192.168...)
  This is the value to put in the box for both the server and other clients
  who wish to connect.
